Digital synthesizer engine for embedded and desktop platforms

### Goals and roadmap:
 * Powerful, versatile DSP engine tailored for sound synthesis. Planned features include
    - [ ] Configurable nubmer of oscillators
    - [ ] Wavetables
    - [ ] Virtual Analog Subtractive
    - [ ] Digital FM
    - [ ] Additive
    - [ ] Filtering
    - [ ] Envelopes/ADSR
    - [ ] LFOs
    - [ ] FX templates
    - [ ] General-purpopse DSP
    
* Modular Unit Design
    - [ ] Customizable units that each implement the synthesis engine
    - [ ] Fully modular interconnection between units
    - [ ] API for synth engine interaction
    - [ ] GUI for ease of use
    - [ ] Terminal application
    
* Build system supporitng multiple architectures
    - [ ] ARM
    - [ ] RISC-V
    - [ ] x86_64
    
* Target Selector for specific MCUs, boards, devkits and desktops:
    - [ ] ST
    - [ ] ESP
    - [ ] PIC
    - [ ] Raspberry PI
    - [ ] Linux
    - [ ] Windows 10
