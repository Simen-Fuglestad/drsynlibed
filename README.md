Digital synthesizer engine for embedded and desktop platforms

### Goals and roadmap:
 * Powerful, versatile Audio Synthesis DSP engine. Planned features include
    - [ ] Configurable oscillators
    - [ ] Wavetables
    - [ ] Virtual Analog Subtractive
    - [ ] Digital FM
    - [ ] Additive
    - [ ] Filtering
    - [ ] Envelopes/ADSR
    - [ ] LFOs
    - [ ] Customizable Modulation Matrix
    - [ ] FX templates
    - [ ] General-purpopse DSP
    
* API that can be fitted to many different software and hardware platforms 
    - [ ] 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit compatibilty
    - [ ] Agnostic C++ with embedded systems in mind 
    - [ ] Configurable build system
